A Device is a   tangible object which contains some logic and is producer and/or consumer of data. A Device is always assumed to be capable of communicating electronically via a network. This data model has been partially developed in cooperation with mobile operators and the [GSMA](https://www.gsma.com/iot/iot-big-data/). This data model reuses concepts coming from the [SAREF Ontology](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103200_103299/103264/01.01.01_60/ts_103264v010101p.pdf) part of [ETSI](http://www.etsi.org) standards.

#### Device NGSI-LD key-values Example    
Here is an example of a Device in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-LD when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.

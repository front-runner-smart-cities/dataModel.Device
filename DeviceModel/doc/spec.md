## Example payloads    
#### DeviceModel NGSI-v2 key-values Example    
Here is an example of a DeviceModel in JSON-LD format as key-values. This is compatible with NGSI-v2 when  using `options=keyValues` and returns the context data of an individual entity.  
<details><summary><strong>show/hide example</strong></summary>    
```json  
{  
  "id": "myDevice-wastecontainer-sensor-345",  
  "type": "DeviceModel",  
  "name": "myDevice Sensor for Containers 345",  
  "brandName": "myDevice",  
  "modelName": "S4Container 345",

  "deviceCategory": ["sensor"],  
  "function": ["sensing"],  
  "controlledProperty": ["fillingLevel", "temperature"]  
}  
```  
</details>  
#### DeviceModel NGSI-v2 normalized Example    
Here is an example of a DeviceModel in JSON-LD format as normalized. This is compatible with NGSI-v2 when not using options and returns the context data of an individual entity.
